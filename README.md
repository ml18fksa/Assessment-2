The readme this to getting a general idea of this project (Site location problem) before running and Add these files to run the project correctly.

This project aims to help companies to generate a map of the importance of each location in the UK depending on three factors excluded from three maps, the first represents the population distribution, the second displays the geographical importance and the last shows transport network. The weight of each factor can be controlled using a slider, and the resulting map (weighted map) can be saved as a raster file. In the result map the lighter the point, the better the place. 

Elements of a project: 
1.	Site location problem.ipynb: the code file with comments. 
2.	best.geology: the geographical importance raster map. 
3.	best.mway: the transport network raster map. 
4.	best.pop: the population distribution raster map. 
5.	weighted_map.txt: the result raster map.
6.	The license file for licence software source code. 
7.	The final file which celled Document project to provide an actual report for the project.  

The way to run this project: 
1.	Make sure you have a Jupyter notebook.  
2.	Open the terminal.  
3.	Navigate to the project folder.  
4.	Write Jupyter notebook and press enter. 
5.	In the browser page click the file site location problem. 
6.	Click inside the code cell. 
7.	Press CTRL + Enter (CMD + Enter). 

The way to use this project: 
After you run the code, change the sliders to give the required weight for each factor, when you are happy with the resulting map, click the save button to save a weighted map in a text file which values range between 0 and 255.
